<p>Since 2018, I have been working in Nvidia's self-driving software team.
  I was an IC for 2 years and then switched to the role of an engineering manager.
  I now manage a team of 10 engineers working across mutliple projects.</p>

<p>I completed my PhD in light field imaging from MIT in 2018. Initially, 
  I was working on using light field imaging for 
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_image_velocimetry"
       target="_blank">PIV</a>/PTV using high speed
  cameras. Later I applied similar technique to perception for autonomous
  robotics. I have previously also worked on a project that aimed at optimizing the
  positioning of heliostats in a solar thermal power plant for maximum
  efficiency and least land area consumed.</p>

<p>I completed my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering from
  the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in May 2011. I grew up in India
  and moved to the US in the August of 2008 to pursue higher education.</p>

<p>I enjoy improving my espresso making skills, cooking, hiking,
  watching great movies and TV shows. I also like taking good
  pictures (mainly of friends and family).</p>
