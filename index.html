<p>I am currently a graduate research assistant at the Massachusetts
  Institute of Technology in the department of Mechanical
  Engineering. I am working on a research project that focuses at the
  developement of
  a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_image_velocimetry"
       target="_blank">PIV</a>/PTV system using an array of high speed
  cameras to track fluid flow in both space and time. I have
  previously also worked on a project that aimed at optimizing the
  positioning of heliostats in a solar thermal power plant for maximum
  efficiency and least land area consumed.</p>


<p>I completed my undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering from
  the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in May 2011. Prior to being
  in college I was in Lucknow, India where I completed high school
  education from <a href="http://lamartinierelucknow.org"
                    target="_blank">La Martiniere College</a> in May
  2008. I moved to the United States in the August of 2008 to pursue
  higher education.</p>


<p>I take great interest in music. I play the piano and I am currently
  learning how to play the guitar. I also wish to learn how to play
  the drums. I sometimes sketch. I cook. I write. I love watching
  movies and am interested in being involved in making a few in the
  future. I like taking pictures and wish to sharpen my photography
  skills. I design websites. The blending of art and science
  fascinates me. Ancient texts inspire and amaze me.</p>
